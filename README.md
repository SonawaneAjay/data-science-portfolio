1. **Predicting Diabetes from Medical Records**: A model to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements. Used Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, to predict the outcome. Also performed exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and transformation. Performed basic feature selection using RFE
2. **Predicting Car prices**: A supervised predictive model to predict prices of the vehicle based upon various attributes (25) of the vehicles. Performed basic data cleaning and transformation operations. Used Linear Regression for prediction, removed outliers and performed basic feature selection using RFE
3. **Forecasting covid 19 cases**: A time series forecasting model to predict number of confirmed cases, recovered cases and deaths using the past data. Used Moving Average model and Holt winter model for forecasting cases for next 30 days.
